== Preparing RHOCP for RHOSP Network Isolation

Network confiuration for the nodes is facilated by the NMState operator.

`NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` offered by nmstate operator allows you to configure network settings on individual nodes in a network. 
This policy can be used to set network interfaces, routing tables, firewall rules, and other network-related settings. 
It is a powerful tool for managing network configurations in a large-scale environment.  

NetworkAttachmentDefinition (NAD) is a feature offered by the NMState operator. 
NAD is used to define network attachment points and states for network devices, allowing for automatic fencing and management of those devices. 

`IPAddressPool` and `L2Advertisement` CRs offered by MetalLB operator facilitates IP advertisement from specified pools, ensuring efficient IP allocation to services and namespaces. 
By leveraging these custom resources, OpenShift facilitates efficient communication between nodes within the cluster, promoting seamless integration and performance optimization in networking-intensive environments.

Please refer to the following table for the network configuration utilized in this deployment:

We will be using a preconfigured set of yaml files in the `files` directory which start with `osp-ng-nncp-`.

FIXME: mention source of these files and a few guidelines to twek these as per the lab infrastructure.

There are 3 files for each of the control plane and worker nodes.

Change to the `files` directory:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
cd ~/labrepo/content/files
----

Apply preconfigured yamls indivdually:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc apply -f osp-ng-nncp-w1.yaml
oc apply -f osp-ng-nncp-w2.yaml
oc apply -f osp-ng-nncp-w3.yaml
oc apply -f osp-ng-nncp-m1.yaml
oc apply -f osp-ng-nncp-m2.yaml
oc apply -f osp-ng-nncp-m3.yaml
----

Wait until they are in an available state before proceeding:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get nncp -w
----

.Sample Output
[source,bash]
----
NAME                              STATUS      REASON
osp-enp1s0-master1-ocp4-master1   Available   SuccessfullyConfigured
osp-enp1s0-master2-ocp4-master2   Available   SuccessfullyConfigured
osp-enp1s0-master3-ocp4-master3   Available   SuccessfullyConfigured
osp-enp1s0-worker-ocp4-worker1    Available   SuccessfullyConfigured
osp-enp1s0-worker-ocp4-worker2    Available   SuccessfullyConfigured
osp-enp1s0-worker-ocp4-worker3    Available   SuccessfullyConfigured
----

Before proceeding configure a *nad* resource for each isolated network to attach a service pod to the network:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc apply -f osp-ng-netattach.yaml
----

Verify the `network-attachment-definations` created with the above command:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get network-attachment-definitions.k8s.cni.cncf.io -n openstack
----

.Sample Output
----
NAME          AGE
ctlplane      5s
external      5s
internalapi   5s
storage       5s
tenant        5s
----

Once the nodes are available and attached << FIXME elaborate configure the *MetalLB IP address range* using a preconfigured yaml file:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc apply -f osp-ng-metal-lb-ip-address-pools.yaml
----

Verify the metallb ip address pools using below command:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get ipaddresspools.metallb.io -n metallb-system 
----

.Sample Output
----
NAME          AUTO ASSIGN   AVOID BUGGY IPS   ADDRESSES
ctlplane      true          false             ["172.22.0.80-172.22.0.90"]
internalapi   true          false             ["172.17.0.80-172.17.0.90"]
storage       true          false             ["172.18.0.80-172.18.0.90"]
tenant        true          false             ["172.19.0.80-172.19.0.90"]
----

Lastly, configure a *L2Advertisement* resource which will define which node advertises a service to the local network which has been preconfigured for your lab environment:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc apply -f osp-ng-metal-lb-l2-advertisements.yaml
----

Verify the configuration:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get l2advertisements.metallb.io -n metallb-system 
----

.Sample Output
----
NAME          IPADDRESSPOOLS    IPADDRESSPOOL SELECTORS   INTERFACES
ctlplane      ["ctlplane"]                                ["enp1s0"]
internalapi   ["internalapi"]                             ["enp1s0.20"]
storage       ["storage"]                                 ["enp1s0.21"]
tenant        ["tenant"]                                  ["enp1s0.22"]
----

FIXME: Any explanation about the significance of these?
