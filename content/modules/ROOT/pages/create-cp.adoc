= Create the OpenStack Control Plane

== Overview 

We will be using a preconfigured file (*files/osp-ng-ctlplane-deploy.yaml*) to create the control plane and at the same time enable the required services, configure the control plane network, and configure the service back ends.

Sample configuration files in the form of Validated Architectures (VAs) may be provided as Feature Pack after release of RHOSP18.
These will be made available in the form of kustomize YAML files.

Kustomize is a Kubernetes-native deployment tool that enables customization of YAML files without altering the original. 
It simplifies resource configuration by allowing base templates to be customized with user data, eliminating the need to write manifests from scratch. 
This abstraction streamlines resource management, enabling users to focus solely on relevant details without requiring full knowledge of Kubernetes YAML structures.

The current onfiguration is derived from the upstream templates available here: 
https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/openstack-operator/blob/dev-preview3/config/samples/

In this deployment, the bastion has a preconfigured NFS service that we will be using to store glance images and cinder volumes.

== Create an NFS share for cinder

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
mkdir /nfs/cinder
chmod 777 /nfs/cinder
----

== Configure NFS storage class

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
mkdir /nfs/pv6
mkdir /nfs/pv7
mkdir /nfs/pv8
mkdir /nfs/pv9
mkdir /nfs/pv10
mkdir /nfs/pv11
chmod 777 /nfs/pv*
----

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc create -f nfs-storage.yaml
----

== Prepare the secret to place the NFS server connection used by Cinder

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc create secret generic cinder-nfs-config --from-file=nfs-cinder-conf
----

== Prepare the secret to place the server connection used by Glance

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc create secret generic glance-cinder-config --from-file=glance-conf
----

== Finally create the OpenStack control plane

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc create -f osp-ng-ctlplane-deploy.yaml
----

Wait until the OpenStack control plane deployment is completed:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get openstackcontrolplane -n openstack
----

WARNING: This can take several minutes.

Repeat the query until MESSAGE is Setup complete

.Sample Output
